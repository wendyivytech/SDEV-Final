 Name: Personal Budget
 Purpose: The purpose of this application is to track a user’s expenses in categories and track averages in those categories and set a limit on those expenses
 Reason: I want to create this application because I think a financial budget is a very useful tool to use to keep track of and manage one’s money
 Goals: I would like to use this application myself; the ultimate goal is to be aware of where my money’s going so I don’t waste this finite resource.
 Audience: My target audience are young people who are new to the workforce and, by extension, a consistent income, people who are of lower economic status who don’t have money to waste, and people who probably don’t pay too much attention to their financial status.
 Outline: users will be able to enter expenses and categorize them. They can generate averages and summaries of these categories for a certain month. And they will be able to set a budget on each category and see if their expenses have gone over budget
